# CF-Instacart-Python-Analysis
This is work that I performed in Jupyter Notebooks to analyze customer and sales data from Instacart as part of my CareerFoundry curriculum. Instacart is an online grocery store that operates though an app.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of Instacart's data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation. Some of the key questions I was answering included:
- What are the busiest days and times of the week?
- How can categorizing products based on price range help us optimize sales?
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
- How do customers differ in demographics and what effect does that have on how they use Instacart?

## Data
For my data sources, I used Instacart's public 2017 data on orders, products, and departments. There was an additional dataset on customer information that CareerFoundry created for the purpose of this project.
